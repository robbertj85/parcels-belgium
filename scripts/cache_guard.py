"""
Cache guard utility for carrier data fetches.

Compares newly fetched location counts against the existing cache. A drop
beyond THRESHOLD_PCT is not trusted on sight: the existing cache is preserved
and the script exits with EXIT_CODE_ANOMALY so the workflow can flag it.

The guard is self-healing. Blocking forever would freeze a cache whenever a
carrier genuinely shrinks -- which is exactly what happened to Amazon, stuck
for eight weeks against a 2180 baseline while every run since fetched ~1200.
So each run's count is appended to data/fetch_history.json, and a large drop
that *repeats* on the next run (within CONFIRM_TOLERANCE_PCT) is accepted as
the new baseline. One-off blips stay blocked; sustained change gets through
after two runs.

Set CACHE_GUARD_FORCE=1 to accept a new baseline immediately, for when you
have already investigated and want to skip the two-run wait.

Usage in fetch scripts:
    from cache_guard import safe_save

    safe_save(
        carrier="DHL",
        new_locations=locations_list,
        output_path=output_path,
        metadata={...},
    )

Exit codes:
    0 = success (data saved)
    2 = data anomaly detected, existing cache preserved
